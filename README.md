# Android-Call-Notifications
This solution contains 2 projects:

1. A web app (EOW) with a SignalR hub where users will be presented with a "secret" message after calling a phone number.

2. An Android app that calls a webservice to trigger the SignalR message to all connected clients in the web app.
